### Description
This project is a  detailed statistical analysis and predictive modeling of stroke dataset. 
There are more than 5000 instances in this dataset, but only 5% of them are stroke cases: this is a highly imbalanced binary-classification problem.
This problem is usually handled by
  - generating synthetic examples of rare class based on the k-nearest neighbour approach (although from precision medicine point of view it might raise questions)
  - choosing a cutoff threshold based on the ROC curve analysis using validation data set.
