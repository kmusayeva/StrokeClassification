This project is a  detailed statistical analysis and predictive modeling of stroke dataset. 
There are more than 5000 instances in this dataset, but only 5% of them are stroke cases. This is a highly imbalanced binary-classification problem.
This problem is usually handled by generating synthetic examples of rare class based on nearest neighbour approach (although from precision medicine point of view it might not be the right approach), as well as choosing a cutoff threshold
well below the standard 0.5 level based on the ROC curve analysis.
